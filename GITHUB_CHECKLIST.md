# GitHub Repository Creation Checklist

## ✅ Before You Start

- [ ] You have a GitHub account
- [ ] You know your GitHub username
- [ ] You're logged into GitHub in your browser

## 📝 Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in these EXACT details:**
   - **Repository name:** `nordic-football-betting` (must be exactly this)
   - **Description:** Nordic Football Betting Platform - F2P sports betting with real football data
   - **Public/Private:** Choose **Public** (recommended for free Render hosting)
   
3. **IMPORTANT - Leave these UNCHECKED:**
   - ❌ Add a README file
   - ❌ Add .gitignore
   - ❌ Choose a license

4. **Click:** "Create repository" button

## 🚀 After Creating Repository

GitHub will show you a page with commands. You can ignore them and use our script instead.

**Run this command:**
```cmd
setup-github.bat
```

The script will:
1. Ask for your GitHub username (default: Koukkukasi)
2. Push all your code to GitHub
3. Show you next steps for Render

## 🔐 If Authentication Fails

Modern GitHub requires Personal Access Token for command line:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Nordic Football Betting Deploy"
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ repo (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)
7. When git asks for password, paste the token (not your GitHub password)

## 🎯 Verification

After successful push, verify at:
- https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nordic-football-betting

You should see all your files there!

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "Repository not found"
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Check the repository name is exactly: `nordic-football-betting`
- Verify your username is correct

### "Authentication failed"
- You need to use a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Make sure the token has 'repo' scope
- The token is used instead of your password

### "Permission denied"
- Make sure the repository is under YOUR account
- Check you're using the right username
